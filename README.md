# Cluster Map

## 1. Definition

A cluster map helps represent dense pockets of data points using a single point. Each cluster is either relatively sized to or labelled with the number of points that have been grouped together.

For example, a cluster map can be an alternative to simplify the reading of the following map:

<img src="img/before.png" alt="before" width="700"/>

And that would be the simplified cluster map:

<img src="img/after.png" alt="after" width="700"/>
